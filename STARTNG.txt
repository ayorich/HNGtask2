My journey so far...

	my journey so far in HNG as been a life changing event as i prepare to take upcoming tasks.



What i have learned so far 

		Getting to know HNG was another step for my pursuit as a developer. HNG as provided me with a community were we all share ideas both as a beginner or expert in the field. I have been able to learn new things and connect with the community thereby increase my network based as the process goes.



What i wish to learn

		What i wish to still get and learn from the community as a beginner developer is to build my skills set level. I would be proud of myself if i can join senior developer to work on real life projects.



What i wish should be improved

		what i wish to be improved in this program is good communication system between mentors and interns.
